* I finished more of the boss' artwork.

2021-04-09		Alexis Peoples		<alexisp30ples@gmail.com>
* Added a quit button to the main menu screen (duh).
* I did a quick fix (hardcoding values) for the textbox repositioning for the tutorial so it'd be ready in time. I plan to go back and figure out a better way after today.
* Added audio I made for the song "twinkle twinkle little star." This song is used in the tutorial letter.
* Added a clock out button to end the tutorial and transition to the more to come scene.
* Finished the prototype.

2021-04-07		Alexis Peoples		<alexisp30ples@gmail.com>
* A "More to Come" scene has been added to the game for the prototype.

2021-04-06		Alexis Peoples		<alexisp30ples@gmail.com>
* The pause menu and its animations are now in the game, however certain buttons (Save, Load, and Settings) have no functionality yet.
* The tutorial is complete (apart from some textbox repositioning that needs to be done).

* 3/4 of the tutorial is now complete.
	* Now, the songbook part and the shop part of the tutorial are done.
	* All that's left to connect to the tutorial is the explanation of the letter typing.
* The boss art is coming together nicely so far. I'm not the best artist, so it is challenging but also worth it.

* The tutorial is halfway complete.
	* If the tutorial was not played when the "at piano" scene starts, the tutorial begins.
	* The boss' dialogue appears and red boxes appear around what the player should click on next as he talks.
	* Red boxes appear around some objects (that the player should pay attention to) that the boss refers to in his dialogue.
	* Buttons that shouldn't be pressed during certain times in the tutorial are disabled.
	* So far only the songbook part of the tutorial is done.

* The intro to the game is complete (except the image for the boss isn't in yet). The intro includes:
	* Opening dialogue with the boss on a black screen; when the dialogue ends, the boss fades away.
	* After the complete black screen, a flickering light animation plays, which unviels the bar for the first time.
	* After the bar is visible for a few seconds, the boss appears again and completes his intro dialogue.
	* Once the boss is finished his dialogue, the scene changes to the "at piano" scene (where the tutorial will start).
* Added some of the tutorial dialogue to the game.
* If the next sentence button is pressed before the dialogue is finished animating, the full sentence is displayed and the player must press the next button again to go to the next sentence.

2021-03-17		Alexis Peoples		<alexisp30ples@gmail.com>
* Implemented fade in/out for scenes.
* Added Bar scene (skeleton).
* Added dialogue system (skeleton).
* Added player movement and collision for bar scene (skeleton).

2021-03-16		Alexis Peoples		<alexisp30ples@gmail.com>
* Wrote most/all of the letters out for the story.
* Completed more of the bar background art.
* Added the (unfinished) scene transition to the game.
Note: Not much was updated this week due to the 4 exams, 1 project, and 2 papers I had to do.
	  I'll do much more in the next progress report.

* The songbook's play, pause, stop, and restart buttons now have images signifying which is which.
* The shop layout has been established in game, however, it doesn't have full functionality yet.
* The Player object was created to hold information about the player, which is only the current amount of money so far.
* The player's current amount of money can be incremented, decremented, and outputted.
* The songs in the shop can be "bought," (meaning a debug message pops up) and the player's money will be updated.
* The songbook has been updated to only show songs that the player owns (excludes the ones not yet bought from the shop).

* When pressed, the songbook button now pulls up an expanded image of the songbook, which displays each song the player currently has unlocked as well as each song's info.
* The songbook can play, pause, stop, and restart each song within it.
* When a letter is being typed, all characters that have already been typed are displayed in green, the next character to be typed is displayed in red, and all other characters not yet typed are displayed in black.

* I created and pushed the PROGRESSLOG, TODO, and README files to the repository.
* Overall explanation of what’s been done so far:
   * I have made a Letter object, a Song object, and their respective handlers. The handlers have functions that return the title/name, the (in)complete status, etc.
   * A letter (all of the sentences) can appear and as you type the characters out correctly, they turn from black to green.
   * A song can be attached to each letter.
   * Each letter can be given its own paper sprite (which changes the appearance of the paper that the sentences appear on).
   * When a sentence is completed (sentence is a misnomer because in the letters, a sentence is actually a sentence fragment), the letter’s connected song plays for a predetermined amount of time. You can’t continue typing until the song pauses again. Every time a sentence is completed, the song plays from the time it last stopped at.
   * If you mistype a character in the letter, a “WRONG!” image appears on screen and doesn’t go away until you type the correct character and the number of mistakes you made in the letter is incremented.
   * Each song can be given a cost (the price to buy it from the shop). Each song has a salary (the amount of money to be paid to you when you play the song). The salary of each song can be incrementally decreased based on a predetermined number of mistakes.
   * The more mistakes you make when typing the letter, the less money you get for playing the connected song.
   * Once the letter is set to complete (meaning all sentences have been typed/completed), the song plays from its current position until it ends.
   * The early layout and basic functionality of the “sitting at the piano” scene is done.
   * Part of the script for the intro and the tutorial is written.
   * Part of the art for the intro scene is completed.
   * Multiple purchasable cosmetics are completed (ex. different themed piano keys).
   * A few other things I can’t fit here.
