# Specification
	"Type In Tune" is a 2D typing game about a newly hired pianist at a rundown bar.
	You play as the pianist and type out letters to play beautiful music for the bar 
	patrons and reveal the story.
	
	** Data Structures **
		I mainly use Lists for everything in the game. Each letter is composed of a 
		list of strings for the sentences and a list of booleans that mark each 
		corresponding sentence as (in)complete.
		
	** Development Platform **
		Unity Version 2.??? (2D Project)
		
	** Deployment Platform **
		Itch.io
