  - Well, here she is. I even made space for your laptop like you asked.
  - "Ain\u2019t I the greatest boss eva\u2019? Don\u2019t answer that yet\u2026"
  - "Anyway, let\u2019s look at the layout of your workspace. The songbook in front
    of you is the song collection."
  - Before the day starts, you can click on it to see stats about the songs you have
    unlocked.
  - When you're playing a song, its title, its timestamp, and the number of mistakes

  - I'll go into more detail about that part later.
  - "For now, why don\u2019t you see what the songbook has right now?"
