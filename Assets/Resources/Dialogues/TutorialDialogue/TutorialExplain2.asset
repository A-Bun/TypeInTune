  - 'See how those colors changed? Let me explain:'
  - "All the black characters are the characters you haven\u2019t reached yet."
  - All the characters you already typed are colored green.
  - The red character is the next character you have to type.
  - "REMEMBER THIS: If you don\u2019t see any red character, that means the next
    character you have to type is a space (using the spacebar of course)."
  - "If you type the wrong character, an indicator will pop up telling you it\u2019s
    wrong and the mistake counter will increase."
  - "Once you type the correct character, the \u201Cwrong character\u201D indicator
    will go away."
  - Go ahead and give failing a try (just to see).
