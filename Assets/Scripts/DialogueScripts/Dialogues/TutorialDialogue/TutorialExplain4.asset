  - Nice playing, kid.
  - That same thing happens at each checkpoint you reach after the first, ...
  - ... the only difference being that the song will continue playing from the place
    it stopped previously.
  - When you finish typing the entire letter, the rest of the song will play until
    completion, so sit back and enjoy the tunes.
  - Once the song is complete, you will receive your payment.
  - Now, finish that letter.
