  - "See, that\u2019s what happens!"
  - "The more mistakes you have, the less money you\u2019ll make for the song, so
    try your best."
  - "Don\u2019t worry, this first letter\u2019s mistakes are free of charge."
  - Anyway, as you type, you will reach checkpoints in the letter.
  - "When you reach the first one, you won\u2019t be able to type the next character
    because the song will start playing."
  - The song will play for a certain amount of time, and once you hear it stop, you
    will be able to start typing again (give or take a few seconds).
  - "Try it out now by typing until you can\u2019t anymore."
