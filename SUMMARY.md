	This semester project has been amazing, scary, extremely educational, and fun. I was so
nervous coming into this class because with all the freedom we had for picking our projects,
I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. When you said that making a game was an option, I knew
immediately that that was what I wanted to do, especially since I just dabbled in game
development for Software I and II. I wanted to see what I could accomplish on my own, without
a team.

	This project really is all my own, and I am extremely proud of it, even with its bugs. I
definitely do think that this project was worthwhile. I learned so much about game development
and how to tackle different tasks I needed to finish. I learned how meticulous, difficult, and
stressful making art on your own is, and I gained a newfound respect for all artists in the 
world. I also gained a newfound respect for my own art skills as well; they aren't as bad as
I assumed! I even got complements from a few people I showed the game to, and that just really
made me feel nice.

	I learned more about how to use Unity and make other animations within it, such as the
pause menu slide in and out, the main menu scrolling text, and the characters typing out
during dialogue. I learned how to add audio clips to my game, and I found some wonderful free
piano music to use. I even found a free virtual piano site to make the Twinkle Twinkle Little
Star song myself, which was fun. I wanted to use my own physical piano to make the music for 
this game, but sadly I didn't have a way to record the piano audio clearly and in a quiet 
environment. I also learned that it is easy to get sweeped away in making art for a game or to
tunnel-vision down a rabbit hole while trying to get a specifc part of the game to work that
doesn't really need to at the time. Time management is really important and can make or break 
you.

	This class made my semester so much better, and I am so grateful for it. Making Type In Tune 
was hard, but I overcame it in the end. Thank you so much Dr. Schwesinger for letting us do
a project that we can actually put some extra passion behind. There were times where I worked on
my project for hours on end without even noticing because I was having such a great time
figuring out issues and making new things. I know the class for this semester was a last minute 
kind of thing, but I really think you/other professors should continue providing it in this 
manner. This concludes my summary. Thanks again, and I hope you have an amazing summer. See you
next semester. (Also, I hope you like the game at least a little haha.)
